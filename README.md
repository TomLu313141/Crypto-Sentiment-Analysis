# Crypto-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I will propose a methodology for cryptocurrency sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) technology based on tweets. I integrated the coding and programming lessons I took before, Web3.0 company internship and project I conducted to come up with this topic.
During this three month, I have finished the code which is based on “Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets”, and its accuracy is 80%. However, I want to improve the accuracy. So, I will use the technique named “Feature Selection.” Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model.

1. Improved accuracy: Feature selection can help to identify the most informative and relevant features in the dataset, which can improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis models.
2. Faster processing: Using a smaller set of selected features can make the sentiment analysis models faster and more efficient to run, especially for larger datasets.
3. Better generalization: Feature selection can help to identify features that are more
generalizable across different datasets, which can improve the performance of sentiment analysis models when applied to new datasets or domains.
Finally, I will show my code and confusion matrix to visualize my model’s performance. Also, I will use video to explain the code I programmed work.
